				 <h2>Background in Teaching</h2>
				 <br>
				

	Initially, Dorothea Dix was known as a schoolteacher and in 1821, she even opened a school for girls in Boston, Massachusetts. However, her career in teaching was interrupted in the mid-1830s due to her ill health, which caused her to eventually abandon teaching and leave Boston altogether. Dix spent two years in England and later returned still frail; however the trip allowed her to familiarize herself with the idea of humane treatment of the mentally disabled. Once Dix returned, her Calvinist beliefs enforced action, and in 1841, a clergyman asked her to teach Sunday school in the East Cambridge House of Correction in Massachusetts due to her background in teaching.
<em></em><br><br>

				<h2><strong>The Beginning of Dorothea Dix’s Investigation<br><br></strong> </h2>



	Dorothea Dix’s students were women found to have serious mental health issues. As Dix taught, she found they were held in filthy and unheated conditions. She appealed to the local court to install stoves in their cells for heat. After this experience, Dix began a study of the current treatment methods of the mentally ill, and found they were held in neglectful and abusive conditions. As someone who promoted exercise, enrichment, and a cheerful society, Dorothea Dix was mortified to observe the inhumane treatment of the insane, and how they were incarcerated with criminals, irrespective of age or sex. This caused her to travel for approximately 2 years throughout the state and noticed similar conditions in each institution she examined. As Dix was successful in Massachusetts, she continued to investigate in states such as Rhode Island, New York, Pennsylvania, and more. She later continued on a tour in Europe in 1854, using similar techniques to examine their institutions.

	Dorothea Dix presented a report to the Massachusetts legislature in January of 1843 following her 18-month survey of the conditions of every jail in Massachusetts. She ended up successful in convincing the legislature to enlarge its asylum in Worcester, Massachusetts. Her report talked about the brutal conditions and how it would be absurd to describe their situation in a softened manner, specifically, she wrote “The condition of human beings, reduced to the extremest states of degradation and misery, cannot be exhibited in softened language, or adorn a polished page”(“Dorothea Dix”). As Dix continued her work, she was able to inspire legislators in 15 US states as well as Canada to establish state hospitals for the mentally ill. She then proceeded to directly affect building 32 mental institutions in the US. During her time in Europe, she caused Pope Pius IX to personally inspect the filthy conditions found in Italian institutions. Even when new institutions were not required, Dix made an effort to enlarge and restaff the existing facilities.
<br><br>
 As well as the mental health reform, Dix joined the prison reform and the penal reform. In 1845, Dorothea Dix published her book, Remarks and Prison Discipline in the United States in order to advocate for improved treatment of ordinary prisoners. Beyond this, Dix’s book also advocated for separation of various types of offenders.
